Could not find a way to connect react to server.js..

I try to run the Nodejs process npm run dev in one terminal and in another terminal start Reactjs using npm start simultaneously in order to connect react and nodejs. Based on the website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-connect-node-js-with-react-js/.

But unfortunately it always shows `Proxy error: Could not proxy request /post from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000 (ECONNRESET).`
or
`Proxy error: Could not proxy request /post from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000/ (ECONNRESET).`
I could not find a way to fix it after hours of searching
